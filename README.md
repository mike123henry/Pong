Unity 5.6 tutorial game

This is my second use of a game engine.
In this game I will continue learning the basics of the Unity 5.6 editor
The online tutorial can be found on youtube at

or on his website (http://www.newthinktank.com/) at http://www.newthinktank.com/2017/06/make-video-games/

I will use C# (edited with Visual Studio 2017 community) for the scripts in the game -- Visual Studio appears to be very slow for this small editing so I will try Sublime Text to edit
